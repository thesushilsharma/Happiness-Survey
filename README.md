# Happiness-Survey
How was your Experience ?

This is a simple web application where users can rate a service in three categories: technical performance, presentation clarity, and ease of use. Users can select one rating per category, and once all categories are rated, the application will log that all ratings are complete.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in building this web application:

HTML
CSS (with Tailwind CSS library)
JavaScript

## How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
- Click on one of the three rating buttons (Happy, Neutral, or Sad).
- For each rating category, select one rating option from the dropdown list (Happy, Neutral, or Sad).
- Once all categories have been rated, a message will be logged to the console stating that all ratings are complete.

## Acknowledgments
